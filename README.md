# ClarionCorp Official Documentation

Our last documentation was in desperate need of an upgrade, so here it is! Shipped right alongside the new API and UI overhaul, hopefully this will be a great tool to getting started into our new API. You can find the live version of this repo at [docs.clarioncorp.net](https://docs.clarioncorp.net).

This documentation is built on [docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) from [facebook](https://github.com/facebook). So if it looks familiar, that's why.
