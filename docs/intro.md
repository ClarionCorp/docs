# Welcome!

Welcome to ClarionCorpâ€™s API Documentation. Here you can understand both the ClarionCorp API, as well as the Odyssey API.


### ClarionCorp API
With the full API rewrite that just happened, we now have extensive documentation going over each of our public endpoints.
If you would like to get started with **our** API, I would recommend starting with [**v2**](/docs/category/v2). If your application relied on the legacy **Corestrike.gg** API, *(and you don't want to convert your code to the new format),* you can get started with [**v1**](/docs/category/v1).


### Odyssey API (Prometheus)
If you are looking to get really in-depth, you can try using the [**Prometheus Proxy**](/docs/category/prometheus-api) directly, but you will need some valid API keys from Odyssey. You can get those by launching your game with Fiddler Classic open, or by generating them from Steam Tickets. We'll probably write a guide on that eventually, but not right now.


### Contributing
