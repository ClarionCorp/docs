This is one of few POST endpoints here.
This is because you can provide the JSON body with `userIds: string[]` to query a bunch of different users at a time.
This will provide the teams that each player is linked to, and for each series/season.
Please note that the teams are not grouped, nor ordered by player. (Like how `Wood ` is on two teams, but `TheHypeWalrus` is between them).
