With no parameters, this just returns a huge list of all of our registered teams and basic player data for them.
If for whatever reason the `linkedId` is `null`, the `player` structure will not be present.
This is because we do not have them cached in our system yet, or their id is wrong internally.
Reach out if you think this is a problem, and we'll try our best to address it.

### Parameters Explained
- Tag
  - This system was built in the event of two seperate teams having the same tag.
  - Therefore, this returns an arrayâ€” even though 99% of the time there will only be one entry.
- Series
  - This is just talking about which tournaments they come from.
  - Currently we support 'EUSL', 'NASL', 'NASA', and 'NAST'.
- Season
  - This is referring to the series' set season, not the game season.
