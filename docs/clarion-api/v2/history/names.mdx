Here you can search either using the **old username**, **new username**, or **current user ID**. Always returns an array.

Previously, we were working on a system that allowed users to remove entries from their name history themselves,
but we ended up indefinitely delaying the overall idea since it was taking too long. It may come back in the future, but for now:

:::success NAME REMOVAL
If you want your name history cleared, and you can prove you own the accountâ€”
please [**join the discord**](https://clarioncorp.net/discord), and shoot me a message (blals), and I will get things settled! ðŸ’š
