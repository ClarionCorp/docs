This endpoint is extremely customizable for fetching data from our local table. This means that you don't need authentication, and you can scan really fast.
I intend to expand more on the parameters here at some point, but the basics can be found in the Quick Usage.

Also, tumbleweeds are entries that have EITHER:
- Less than 10 games played
- Less than 10 games won
- Less than 10 games lost
By default, entries matching any of these are hidden since there isn't enough data to compare fairly. You can re-enable them if you'd like.


If you need the list of characters matching their IDs, you can check out [this page](/docs/FAQ/characterids.md).
