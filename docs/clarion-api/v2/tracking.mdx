:::warning[Protected Endpoint]

This endpoint requires authentication to access. You can learn more about that [here](/docs/FAQ/authentication).

This is not what *you* would use on OBS. You can find an OBS-Compatible widget on your CC Player Card.

This endpoint replies with a short history of rating changes for a specific player.
If a Player is not currently being tracked, it will start tracking upon first request.
Internally, this will trigger a cronjob that will refresh tracked players every few minutes.
Tracked Players whose rating has not changed for 3 hours will stop being tracked here.

The system will automatically create two identical entries for the player's current rating,
in order to draw a straight line in the overlay.

This system may change in the future, and may or **may not** becoming tracking v3.
